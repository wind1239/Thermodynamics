Dear Mr. Gomes:

We assigned a very low fictitious value (0.000001 atm) 
for pure polymer vapor pressure. We then solved for 
parameters "a" and "b" by matching pure component fugacity 
coef. of polymer liquid and "vapor" phases calculated at the 
above fictitious pressure.  This approach was based on
Joeffe's method (IEChem Fundam., 15, 1976, p. 298).

Please let us know if we can be of any further help,

Nese Orbey
