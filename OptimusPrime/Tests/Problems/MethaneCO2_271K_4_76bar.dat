# Equations of State:  
#     If the first line is

#        then an EOS is assigned to each component otherwise;
#     If the first line is 
#           Equations_of_State   "All"  "Peng-Robinson"
#        then ONE EOS is assigned to ALL components.
#
#     If the option of EOS is Peng-Robinson-Stryjek-Vera, then a real (i.e., floating)

# For the time being only Peng-Robinson and Peng-Robinson-Stryjek-Vera are available.
